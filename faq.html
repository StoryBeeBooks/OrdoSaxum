                  • Natural Stone: Marble, Granite, Quartzite, Onyx, Travertine, and Dolomite.<br>

                <h4 class="faq-question">What is the difference between Quartz and Quartzite?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  This is a common and important question. Quartzite is a natural, metamorphic rock that is very hard and durable, known for its beautiful, often marble-like veining. Quartz is an engineered, man-made product composed of crushed quartz crystals, resins, and pigments. It is non-porous and highly resistant to stains and scratches. We can show you stunning examples of both at our showroom.

                <h4 class="faq-question">Do I need to seal my granite countertops?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Yes, natural stones like granite are porous and should be sealed upon installation and periodically thereafter (typically once a year) to protect against staining. Sealing is a simple process that helps maintain the stone's beauty for decades.
                </p>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4 class="faq-question">Are marble countertops a good choice for a busy kitchen?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Marble is a timeless choice known for its elegance. However, it is a softer, more porous stone than granite or quartzite and can be susceptible to etching from acidic liquids (like lemon juice) and staining if not sealed properly. It is a fantastic choice for those who appreciate its natural patina over time. For clients seeking high durability with a similar look, we often recommend Quartzite or Quartz.

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4 class="faq-question">How do I clean my new quartz countertops?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Cleaning quartz is very easy. Simply use a soft cloth with warm water and a mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals, abrasive scrubbers, or bleach, as they can damage the surface finish.

                <h4 class="faq-question">How is the price of a stone slab determined?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  The price of a stone slab is influenced by several key factors:<br>
                  • Material Type: Natural stones like quartzite and marble often have a wider price range than many standard quartz options.<br>
                  • Rarity and Origin: Exotic slabs sourced from exclusive quarries around the world are priced higher than more commonly available stones.<br>
                  • Slab Thickness: While standard thicknesses are the norm, custom thickness can affect the price.<br>
                  • Finish: Special finishes like honed, leathered, or polished can also impact the final cost.

                <h4 class="faq-question">Can you provide a price quote for my project?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  As the slab supplier, Ordosaxum provides the price for the material (the slabs) only. We can give you a clear cost for the specific slabs you select in our showroom. For a complete "all-in" project quote that includes templating, fabrication (cutting), and installation, you will need to speak with your chosen fabricator. They will provide a final price that includes our slab cost and their labour.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Yes, investing in premium stone countertops is one of the best ways to add significant and lasting value to your Toronto property.

                  After you have selected and paid for your slab, we coordinate directly with your fabrication company. They will arrange to pick up the slab from our Toronto warehouse. We ensure the slab is ready and accessible for a smooth and professional handover.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  We do not deliver slabs to residential job sites. Slabs are large, heavy, and require specialized equipment and expertise to handle and transport safely. This is why they are always transported to the fabricator's workshop, where they have the proper tools (like gantry cranes and A-frames) to manage the material before it's cut and prepared for installation at your Mississauga or Oakville home.

                  We can hold your purchased slabs for a reasonable period while you coordinate the final details with your contractor or fabricator. We ask that you discuss your project timeline with our team during the selection process so we can make suitable arrangements for your specific needs.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Bookmatching is the practice of matching two or more stone slabs from the same block, so that the two adjoining surfaces mirror each other, like an open book. This creates a stunning, continuous pattern and is often used for large feature walls, waterfall islands, and fireplace surrounds. We often carry slabs in consecutive order that are ideal for bookmatching. If this is a requirement for your project, please inform our specialists, and they will show you our available bookmatched sets.

                <h4 class="faq-question">What are the typical dimensions and thickness of your slabs?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Slab dimensions vary based on the specific block of natural stone or the production run of engineered quartz. On average, slabs are roughly 120 x 70 inches. The standard thickness for countertop applications in the North American market is 3cm (1 1/4 inches). We also stock certain materials in 2cm (3/4 inch), which is often used for backsplashes or specialty applications.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  The most common finish is Polished, which creates a shiny, reflective surface that brings out the stone's vibrant colors and details. We also offer slabs with a Honed finish (a matte, smooth surface with little to no shine) and a Leathered finish (a soft sheen with a textured feel that is popular for hiding fingerprints). Availability of these finishes varies by material.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Natural stones like granite and marble often have inherent characteristics, including small fissures or pits. These are not typically defects but rather part of the stone's natural formation and unique character. Our high-quality slabs are structurally sound. During fabrication, any significant fissures are typically reinforced with epoxy by the fabricator to ensure long-term durability.

                  Yes, creating a full-height backsplash with the same slab as your countertop is a luxurious and high-impact design trend. It creates a seamless, continuous look that is both beautiful and easy to clean. This is a popular choice for custom homes in areas like Oakville and Vaughan.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  A waterfall edge is a design feature where the countertop material continues down the side of the island or cabinet, all the way to the floor. It creates a continuous flow of the stone's pattern. Our slabs are perfectly suited for this application, and it's a very popular and dramatic feature that requires a skilled fabricator to execute perfectly.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  For outdoor applications in the Canadian climate, it is crucial to select a stone that can withstand UV rays and freeze-thaw cycles. We typically recommend Granite as the best choice for outdoor kitchens in Markham and the GTA due to its exceptional durability and resistance to the elements. Most engineered quartz products are not warrantied for outdoor use as their resins can yellow with prolonged sun exposure.

                  Natural stone is a highly sustainable building material. It is a natural product of the Earth, requiring no chemicals for its creation. Its key environmental benefits include:<br>
                  • Durability & Longevity: A stone countertop can last for generations, reducing the need for replacement and the waste associated with it.<br>
                  • Low VOCs: Natural stone is not manufactured with resins or plastics, so it does not off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs), contributing to better indoor air quality.<br>
                  • Recyclability: Old stone can be recycled and repurposed for other uses, from aggregate to smaller design elements.

                  Every slab in our Toronto warehouse meets the "Ordosaxum Standard." This means each piece has been individually inspected for:<br>
                  • Structural Integrity: We ensure there are no major defects, deep cracks, or weaknesses that would compromise the slab during fabrication or use.<br>
                  • Aesthetic Quality: We look for exceptional color, clarity of pattern, and consistency within the block.<br>
                  • Accurate Calibration: We verify that the slab's thickness is consistent to ensure a smooth fabrication and installation process.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  For a historic Toronto home, we often recommend materials that honour the classic aesthetic. Timeless choices like Carrara Marble or Calacatta Marble are historically appropriate and beautiful. For clients who desire a classic marble look but with enhanced durability for a modern family lifestyle, we would suggest a white or grey Quartzite which can mimic the look of marble but offers superior hardness and stain resistance.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  For a demanding commercial environment like a bar, durability is paramount. We would strongly recommend either:<br>
                  • Dark, dense Granite: It is extremely hard, scratch-resistant, and less likely to show stains or etching from acidic drinks.<br>
                  • Engineered Quartz: As a non-porous material, it is exceptionally resistant to staining from wine, citrus, and coffee, and it requires no sealing.<br>
                  Both options are available in a wide range of stylish, sophisticated designs suitable for a high-end commercial space.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Seams are a normal part of countertop installation, especially for large or L-shaped layouts where the dimensions exceed that of a single slab. However, the goal is always to minimize their number and visibility. This is where a skilled fabricator is essential. They will work to optimize layout, ensure a tight fit, and use color-matched epoxy to create precise, tight joins between the stone pieces. When you select your slab with us, we can discuss your layout and help you choose a material with a pattern that will lend itself to less visible seams.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  While samples are a great tool for initial design, they cannot represent the full range of color and pattern present in a natural stone slab. This is a key reason we insist our clients view and approve the full slab in our warehouse. The final installed countertop will be cut from that specific slab you selected, so you know exactly what the final product will look like. For engineered quartz, the pattern is generally more consistent, but slight variations can still occur between production batches.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Etching is a chemical reaction that happens when acidic substances (like vinegar, wine, or lemon juice) come into contact with the calcium carbonate in marble. It removes the polish and leaves a dull, lighter-colored spot on the surface. A "patina" is the collection of these etches and small signs of wear over many years. Many people cherish this patina as it signifies a well-loved, well-used surface that tells a story, much like the marble countertops in a historic European bakery. For those who prefer a pristine surface, we recommend quartzite or quartz.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Not at all. The application of resin is a standard, high-quality practice for many natural stones, especially more delicate materials like some marbles and quartzites. During the polishing process at the quarry, a penetrating resin is applied to the slab's surface. This fills in any natural micro-fissures or pits, reinforcing the stone's structural integrity and enhancing its final polish. It is a sign of a properly processed, high-quality slab, not a defect.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Yes, for natural stone, this is completely normal and part of its inherent beauty. Since natural stone is a product of the earth, no two slabs are ever 100% identical, even when cut from the same block (known as "consecutive slabs"). There will be natural variations in veining, color tone, and pattern. A skilled fabricator will artfully arrange the templates on the slabs to ensure the best possible flow and pattern match at the seams, celebrating these unique characteristics.

Because natural stone has inherent variations, it is much easier to find a paint color or tile that complements the unique slab you fall in love with than it is to find a slab that perfectly matches a pre-selected paint color. Bring your cabinet and flooring samples with you when you visit our showroom to see how they look next to the full slab.

                <h4 class="faq-question">Can I use a leftover piece of my slab for another project, like a vanity top or a cutting board?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Yes, this is a great way to be sustainable and create a cohesive look in your home. The leftover portion of a slab after your countertops are cut is called a "remnant." These remnants are perfect for smaller projects like bathroom vanities, shower niches, small tabletops, or even custom serving boards. Discuss this with your fabricator, as they will have the remnant and can advise you on the cost of fabricating these additional pieces.

                <h4 class="faq-question">What do I do if I get a stain on my natural stone countertop?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  The first step is to identify the type of stain (e.g., oil-based, organic like coffee or wine, etc.). For most common stains, you can use a targeted cleaning method. A highly effective technique for stubborn stains is to use a "poultice"—a paste-like cleaning agent that is spread on the stain, covered, and left to dry, which pulls the stain out of the stone. We can provide basic guidance, and there are many resources online for specific stain types. For severe stains, a professional stone restoration specialist in the GTA may be required.

                <h4 class="faq-question">I chipped the edge of my quartz countertop. Can it be repaired?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  Yes, in most cases, small chips in quartz or natural stone countertops can be professionally repaired. A skilled fabricator or a stone repair specialist can fill the chip with a color-matched epoxy or acrylic adhesive, then sand and polish the area to blend it seamlessly with the rest of the surface. It is a delicate process, and we strongly recommend hiring a professional in the Toronto area to handle the repair.

                <h4 class="faq-question">My polished marble has a dull spot after a lemon spilled on it. What happened?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  This is called an "etch," not a stain. The acid from the lemon reacted with the calcium carbonate in the marble and corroded the surface, removing the shine. While a stain is a discoloration, an etch is physical damage to the stone's finish. Minor etches on polished surfaces can sometimes be fixed with a marble polishing powder. For more significant etching, you will need to contact a professional stone restoration company in the GTA to re-hone and re-polish the surface.

                <h4 class="faq-question">Marble vs. Quartzite: Which is better for a kitchen?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  This depends on your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences.<br>
                  • Marble: Offers a classic, timeless beauty with soft, elegant veining. It is softer and more porous, meaning it will etch and can stain if not diligently cared for. It is perfect for those who appreciate a "living finish" that develops a patina over time.<br>
                  • Quartzite: Often has a similar visual appeal to marble but is a much harder and more durable natural stone (ranking higher on the Mohs scale of hardness). It is highly resistant to scratching and etching, making it an excellent choice for busy kitchens in family homes where durability is as important as beauty.

                <h4 class="faq-question">Granite vs. Quartz: What's the main difference in performance?</h4>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                  This is a classic comparison between a natural stone and an engineered one.<br>
                  • Granite: A natural igneous rock, each slab is entirely unique. It is highly heat-resistant (you can place hot pots on it) and scratch-resistant. It is porous and requires sealing to prevent stains. It is an excellent choice for both indoor and outdoor kitchens.<br>
                  • Quartz: An engineered product made from 90-95% crushed natural quartz mixed with resins and pigments. It is non-porous, requiring no sealing, and highly resistant to staining. However, it is not as heat-resistant as granite and can be damaged by very hot pots. It is ideal for low-maintenance, high-performance applications indoors.
