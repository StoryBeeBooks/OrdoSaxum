          <h2 class="expertise-section-title">📖 Our Story</h2>
          <p class="expertise-text">
            OrdoSaxum was born from a simple yet profound belief: that stone, in the hands of skilled artisans equipped with modern technology, can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p class="expertise-text">
            What began as a modest fabrication workshop, driven by passion and an uncompromising commitment to quality, has evolved into a comprehensive stone solutions provider. Our journey has been one of continuous growth—not just in size, but in capability, expertise, and reputation.
          </p>
          <p class="expertise-text">
            Today, we stand as a bridge between two worlds: the ancient art of stonecraft that has built civilizations for millennia, and the precision of contemporary digital fabrication technology. Our facility houses state-of-the-art CNC machinery alongside master craftsmen who understand stone not as a commodity, but as a living material with unique character and potential.
          </p>
          <p class="expertise-text">
            Every slab that passes through our facility tells two stories: the geological narrative written over millions of years by nature itself, and the human story we add through careful selection, expert fabrication, and thoughtful installation. We are honored to be part of both narratives.
          </p>
          <p class="expertise-text">
            As we continue to grow, our foundation remains unchanged: exceptional quality, meticulous craftsmanship, and genuine care for the clients who entrust us with their most important spaces.

            <p class="expertise-text">
              We believe the future of stonework lies not in choosing between tradition and innovation, but in their harmonious integration. Our CNC machines execute with mathematical precision, but our artisans bring the soul, the judgment, and the artistic sensibility that no algorithm can replicate. Technology is our tool; craftsmanship is our essence.

              Every stone we work with carries a history measured in geological epochs—formed under immense pressure, shaped by ancient seas, marked by time itself. We honor this legacy through responsible stewardship: sourcing from ethical suppliers who respect both the environment and the communities they operate within, optimizing our processes to minimize waste, and treating each piece with the reverence it deserves.

            <p class="expertise-text">
              Stone speaks a language of texture, color, pattern, and depth. Each slab is unique—a singular expression of geological forces. We approach our work as translators and interpreters, revealing the inherent beauty within each piece and positioning it where it can make its most powerful statement. This is our art: finding the perfect stone for the perfect space.
