          <h2 class="expertise-section-title">❓ How To's</h2>
          
          <div class="expertise-card">
            <h3 class="expertise-card-title">How to Choose the Right Stone for Your Project</h3>
            <p class="expertise-text">
              Selecting the perfect stone involves balancing aesthetics, functionality, and practical considerations:
            </p>
            <ol class="expertise-list">
              <li><strong>Define Your Application:</strong> Consider where the stone will be installed—kitchen countertops require different characteristics than bathroom vanities or fireplace surrounds. High-traffic areas demand greater durability.</li>
              <li><strong>Assess Durability Needs:</strong> Evaluate resistance to heat, scratching, staining, and etching based on expected use. Sintered stone offers superior performance for demanding applications, while certain natural stones excel in specific contexts.</li>
              <li><strong>Understand Maintenance Commitment:</strong> Natural stones typically require periodic sealing and more attentive care, while sintered surfaces are virtually maintenance-free. Consider your preference for ongoing maintenance.</li>
              <li><strong>Explore Aesthetic Options:</strong> Review color palettes, veining patterns, and finish options. Natural stone offers unique, one-of-a-kind character; sintered stone provides consistent, predictable appearance.</li>
              <li><strong>Consider Budget Comprehensively:</strong> Factor in not just material cost, but fabrication complexity, installation requirements, and long-term maintenance expenses.</li>
              <li><strong>Consult Our Experts:</strong> Our design consultants bring extensive experience in matching materials to applications. We help you navigate options and make informed decisions aligned with your priorities.</li>

          <div class="expertise-card">
            <h3 class="expertise-card-title">How to Care for Your Stone Surfaces</h3>
            <p class="expertise-text">
              Proper care ensures your stone surfaces maintain their beauty and performance for decades:
            </p>
            <ul class="expertise-list">
              <li><strong>Daily Cleaning:</strong> Use pH-neutral stone cleaner with a soft microfiber cloth. Avoid acidic cleaners (vinegar, lemon-based products) and harsh chemicals that can damage or etch surfaces.</li>
              <li><strong>Immediate Spill Response:</strong> Blot spills immediately—particularly acidic substances (wine, citrus, tomatoes) or staining agents (coffee, oil). Quick action prevents penetration and staining.</li>
              <li><strong>Surface Protection:</strong> Use cutting boards for food preparation, trivets for hot cookware, and coasters under glasses. While stone is durable, direct impact or extreme temperature changes can cause damage.</li>
              <li><strong>Periodic Sealing (Natural Stone):</strong> Most natural stones benefit from annual resealing to maintain stain resistance. We provide guidance on appropriate sealers and application schedules. Sintered stone requires no sealing.</li>
              <li><strong>Avoid Abrasives:</strong> Never use abrasive scrubbers, scouring powders, or harsh chemicals that can scratch polished surfaces or degrade sealers.</li>
              <li><strong>Professional Maintenance:</strong> For deep cleaning, restoration, or resealing, consult professional stone care specialists to avoid damage from improper techniques or products.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="expertise-card">
            <h3 class="expertise-card-title">How to Prepare for Stone Installation</h3>
            <p class="expertise-text">
              Proper preparation ensures smooth installation and optimal results:
            </p>
            <ul class="expertise-list">
              <li><strong>Clear the Area:</strong> Remove all items from cabinets and countertops. Protect flooring and nearby surfaces from dust and potential damage.</li>
              <li><strong>Ensure Access:</strong> Provide clear pathways from entry points to installation areas. Heavy stone slabs require unobstructed access.</li>
              <li><strong>Verify Utilities:</strong> Ensure plumbing and electrical work is complete before installation. Post-installation modifications can damage stone.</li>
              <li><strong>Cabinet Preparation:</strong> Cabinets must be level, properly secured, and capable of supporting stone weight. Address any structural concerns beforehand.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan for Dust:</strong> Stone installation generates dust despite mitigation efforts. Seal off adjacent rooms and cover furniture if possible.</li>
              <li><strong>Coordinate Trades:</strong> Schedule final plumbing fixture installation, backsplash work, and appliance installation after stone installation is complete.</li>
