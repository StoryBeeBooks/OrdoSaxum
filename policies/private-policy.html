            <h2 class="policy-title">1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
            <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the OrdoSaxum brand website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.</p>
            <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and the legal entity that owns and operates the OrdoSaxum brand (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>

            <h2 class="policy-title">2. Automatic Collection of Information</h2>
            <p>When you open the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device’s IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences, the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website and Services, pages of the Website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on the Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
            <p>Information collected automatically is used to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular User of the system.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="policy-section">
            <h2 class="policy-title">3. Collection of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the features offered on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address).</p>
            <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any forms on the Website. When required, this information may include contact information (such as email address, phone number, etc.) and geolocation data of your device (such as latitude and longitude).</p>
            <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing partners.</p>
            <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>

            <h2 class="policy-title">4. Privacy of Children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission.</p>
            <p>If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.</p>

            <h2 class="policy-title">5. Use and Processing of Collected Information</h2>
            <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor under the framework of applicable privacy laws. We act as a data controller when we ask you to submit Personal Information necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information in compliance with the laws of Ontario and Canada, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).</p>
            <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
              <li>Send administrative information, such as product and service updates</li>
              <li>Request user feedback</li>
              <li>Improve user experience</li>
              <li>Enforce our terms and conditions and policies</li>
              <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
              <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
              <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located, and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; or (iv) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
            <p>We will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

            <h2 class="policy-title">6. Disclosure of Information</h2>
            <p>Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our parent company, our trusted affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you. This information is shared for operational, business analysis, and strategic purposes across our corporate family. We will not share any personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>

Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we contractually prohibit them from using or disclosing any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>

            <h2 class="policy-title">7. Data Analytics</h2>
            <p>Our Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information.

            <h2 class="policy-title">8. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
            <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. The Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information.</p>
